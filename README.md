# A-Star-Maze
Using A*, we solve randomized mazes

### TODO

* Create 50 randomized mazes
* Create a gui to visualize the maze
* A* Algorithms
    * Forward
    * Backward
    * Adaptive

# I was thinking about datastructers that we could need:

* LL for the visisted, so we don't visit the same node twice  
* MIN Heap, which is just a sorted LL or an AVL tree
* Two 2-D arrays, one with the maze, one with the robot in it

* Let me know what you guys think (Roslan)
