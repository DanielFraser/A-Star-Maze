# A-Star-Maze
Using A*, we solve randomized mazes

### TODO

* :heavy_check_mark: Create 50 randomized mazes
* :construction: Create a gui to visualize the maze
* :construction: A* Algorithms
    * :heavy_check_mark: Forward
    * :heavy_check_mark: Backward
    * :x: Adaptive

# I was thinking about datastructers that we could need:

* LL for the visisted, so we don't visit the same node twice  
* MIN Heap, which is just a sorted LL or an AVL tree
* Two 2-D arrays, one with the maze, one with the robot in it

* Let me know what you guys think (Roslan)
