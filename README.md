# A-Star-Maze
Using A*, we solve randomized mazes that have a fog of war (agent has to move in order to reveal rest of maze).

It is able to do: repeated forward, repeated backward, and Adaptive A\*. Also able to change how it breaks ties using g values (small g vs big g)

## Screenshots
### green = start, red = goal, blue = where agent has gone
